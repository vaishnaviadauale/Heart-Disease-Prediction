# Heart-Disease-Prediction Project 
## Problem:
World Health Organization has estimated 12 million deaths occur worldwide, every year due to Heart diseases. Half the deaths in the United States and other developed countries are due to cardio vascular diseases. The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high risk patients and in turn reduce the complications. This project predict the heart disease using logistic regression.

## Solution:
The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has heart disease or not
I have implemented Logistic Regression Model to predict Coronary Heart Disease.

## What is Logistic Regression ?
Logistic Regression is a statistical and machine-learning techniques classifying records of a dataset based on the values of the input fields . It predicts a dependent variable based on one or more set of independent variables to predict outcomes . It can be used both for binary classification and multi-class classification.
